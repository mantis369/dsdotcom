<h1>You're not going to like this</h1>
<h2>But it should be good enough for you</h2>
<p>I have left Facebook and Instagram, forever. Fuck Zuck. For the moment, probationally, I have the use of <a href="https://twitter.com/DerikStiller">@DerikStiller</a> on Twitter, to follow and interact with real life acquaintances. I am @cybermantis on SnapChat.</p>
<p><strong>Why did I do it?</strong> Mostly for my mental health. I am a bipolar ragemonster and I can't continue to be on enough mood stabilizer for a horse just so I don't make negative contact with your ill-considered beliefs. My use of technology is for my convenience, not yours.</p>
<p>On Facebook services, you are not the customer, your data is the product. Your emotional response to shiny gewgaws to buy and the news of the kakistocracy's latest activities, interspersed with the occasional news that some cis het white male has murdered people, but we won't be doing anything about it.</p>
<p>I am tired of you people who don't really know me, or haven't talked to me for years, asking for computer-related favors and pretending to service my needs as a social human being.</p>
<p>I am tired of the cowards who avoid me because I am a "mental defective" which means that they don't understand bipolar disorder or smart people and they caught me having a Darth Vader moment or thinking I was Jesus Christ and didn't have the patience or kindnesss to ease my readjustment to reality.</p>
<p>I am tired of having to pretend to be heteronormative. Let's get it out there. I enjoy role playing strong female villains with similar personalities to mine. I am bisexual.</p>
<p>I am tired of humoring people who believe in God and don't see that indoctrination in childhood is child abuse. And that their belief system is gross justification in a post hoc sense of terrorism of every kind. I am an atheist. I am also spiritual. My cosmic truth and revelations will not get into your head unless you self-insert them.</p>
<p>I started on IRC and Usenet in 1993, and AOL in 1997, and LiveJournal in 1999. AIM away messages with lyrical obscura and the ability to actually filter who saw each post and who commented, went away as as ad monetization appeared. Like Winamp, we got this stuff right 20 years ago.</p>
<p>I'll be writing a new blog soon, and I'll link it here. In the meantime, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1CPmTJHyeVRWsc6Va27fpQ">take me to the pilot. Lead me to the chamber. Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger...Take me to the pilot for control. Take me to the pilot of your soul.</a></p>
